        <h2>Hello, I am Yash Khatri</h2>
        <p> I'm a Computer Science student currently studying in Manipal University Jaipur. I am a sports enthusiast and also love to learn new things.I have been living in Delhi since my birth and shifted to jaipur for my undergrad in 2024. I live in Ghs hostel provided by muj itself. I love spending time online surfing new stuffs and new videos.When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me exploring new ideas or working on college tech events with my team.Right now, I’m gaining experience in Python, C, data handling, DBMS, and core CS fundamentals. I recently built a Smart Student Management System, which helped me improve my understanding of data structures and record management.
